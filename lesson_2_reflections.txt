What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

* An empty repository is created, which contains no commit. It works 
that way so that it won't automatically include files you actually 
don't want to keep track of.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate area where I can add changes before
committing them to the repository. This allows me to add changes to the
staging area one-by-one, then commit them all at once, which makes it 
easier to specify what changes should go into each commit. That makes 
the commits more valuable, since the commit history is easier to 
navigate when I create one commit per logical change.
